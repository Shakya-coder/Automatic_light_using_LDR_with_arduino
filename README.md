# Automatic_light_using_LDR_with_arduino
A simple arduino project based on elctricity saving theme 

Compoenents required to make circuit:-
1. Arduino
2. breadboard
3. LDR or Photoresistor
4. 1k ohm and 220 k ohm resistors
5. LED
6. Some wires (jumper wire)

Code:-
Upload the code in arduino given in code file

Tip:-
In case ur LED fluctuates change the value of threshold accordingly
